**Effective Date:** December 6, 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 6, 2024  

CellMetaFinder is a Google Sheets extension designed to assist users in searching and integrating ontology terms into their spreadsheets. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how the app interacts with your data.

## 1. Data Collection
CellMetaFinder does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The app only interacts with the following Google services:

- **Google Sheets API**: To read and write data in the active spreadsheet.  
- **Script API**: To execute external ontology search requests and integrate the results into the spreadsheet.  
- **Container UI API**: To create a user-friendly interface for searching and selecting terms.  

## 2. Third-Party Requests
- The app makes API requests to our Ontology Search API to retrieve ontology terms based on user input.  
- These requests are processed in real-time and are not stored by the app.  

## 3. Data Usage
All data processing happens within your Google Sheets instance. No user data is transmitted or saved outside of the user's spreadsheet environment.

## 4. Security
The app operates within Google's secure environment and does not handle sensitive or personal information.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Any updates will be reflected on our official repository or app listing.
